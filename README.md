## final three pages
the goal of this assignment was to add the special offers, blog, and contact pages to the travel fly assignment. The main issue I ended up having was organization, since there were so many divs to keep track of. In the end, I was able to keep track by drawing diagrams and referencing the adobe XD file as often as possible. I also made the pages responsive to 800px screen sizes using media queries. The contact page has input boxes that are able to be typed in but do not submit anywhere.
